# Overview

DynEarthSol3D, DES3D in short, is a finite element code that solves the momentum balance and 
the heat transfer in Lagrangian form using unstructured meshes. It can be
used to study the long-term deformation of Earth's lithosphere and problems
alike.

# Building DES3D
## Requirements
* You will need a recent C++ compiler that supports C++11 standard. (GNU g++
  4.4 or newer version will suffice.)
* You will need a recent version of `Boost::Program_options` library (1.42 or
  newer version). Instructions for building the library:
  * Download the source code from www.boost.org
  * In the untarred source directory, run `./bootstrap.sh`
  * In the same directory, run `./b2 --with-program_options -q` to build
     the library.
* You will need Python 2.6+ or 3.2+ and the Numpy package.
### Optional packages
* [Exodus](https://github.com/gsjaardema/seacas/) for importing a mesh in the ExodusII format
  * Suggested building procedure
    * Run the following in the root directory of DES3D:
      ```BASH
      git clone https://github.com/sandialabs/seacas.git
      cd seacas && export ACCESS=`pwd`
      COMPILER=gnu MATIO=NO GNU_PARALLEL=NO CGNS=NO FMT=NO ./install-tpl.sh
      mkdir build; cd build
      ../cmake-exodus
      make; make install
      ```
  * The above procedure will download and build NetCDF and HDF5; and then build EXODUS.
  * The header files and built shared library will be in `./seacas/include` and `./seacas/lib`. 
* [MMG3D](https://www.mmgtools.org/mmg-remesher-downloads) for mesh optimization during remeshing in three-dimensional models
  * Suggested building procedure
    * Run the following in the root directory of DES3D:
      ```BASH
      git clone https://github.com/MmgTools/mmg.git
      cd mmg; mkdir build; cd build
      cmake ..
      make
      ```
    * The header files and built shared library will be in `mmg/build/include` and `mmg/build/lib`. 
## Building procedure
* Edit `Makefile` 
  * Modify `BOOST_ROOT_DIR` if you manually built or installed 
  boost library.
    * If you followed the instructions above to build 
  `Boost::Program_options` library, set `BOOST_ROOT_DIR` to the untarred boost
  directory.
  * If importing an exodus mesh:
    * Set `useexo = 1` and `ndims = 3`. Only 3D exodus mesh can be imported.
    * Set `EXO_INCLUDE` and `EXO_LIB_DIR` paths if different from the default values.
  * If mesh optimization with mmg is desired for remeshing:
    * Set `usemmg = 1`.
    * Set `MMG_INCLUDE` and `MMG_LIB_DIR` paths if different from the default values.
* Run `make` to build optimized executable.
* Or run `make opt=0` to build a debugging executable.
* Or run `make openmp=0` to build the executable without OpenMP. This is
  necessary to debug the code under valgrind.

# Running DES3D
* Execute `dynearthsol2d [inputfile: examples/defaults.cfg by default]`.
* Pay attention to any warnings. For instance, if a warning about potential 
  race condition is printed on screen, do follow the given suggestions.
* Several example input files are provided under `examples/` directory. The
  format of the input file is described in `examples/defaults.cfg`.
* Benchmark cases with analytical solution can be found under `benchmarks/`
  directory.
* Execute the executable with `-h` flag to see the available input parameters
  and their descriptions.

# Visualizing DES3D outputs
* Run `2vtk.py [modelname: 'results' by default]` to convert the binary output to VTK files.
* Execute `2vtk.py -h` to see more usage information.
* Some of the simulation outputs might be disabled. Edit `2vtk.py` and
  `output.cxx` to disable/enable them.
* Plot the VTK files with [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/download/) or [Visit](https://visit-dav.github.io/visit-website/).
